   role: CONFOUNDER # CONFOUNDER | VARIABLE - perform a chi2 test for dependency for each variable with all confounders
   type: CATEGORY # CATEGORY | QUARTILE - how to induce the partition. CATEGORY split samples into blocks based on the exact expression in the column used for partitioning (e.g. male, female). QUARTILE form a block of each of the upper and lower quartile accoridng to the values in the column used for partitioning. Column values must be numerical (e.g. upper and lower quartile of a numerical age column)
